# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Python

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. I have used the Cleveland database This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. I have used Logistic regression to find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health. 

The diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on 1, ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests 2.


This dataset is old and small by today's standards. However, it's allowed me to create a simple model and then use regression to explain the dataset. The number of major factors and aspects of ECG results dominated the regression result.
